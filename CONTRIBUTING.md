# Contributing

## Getting Started

General information about setting up your Python environment, testing modules,
Ansible coding styles, and more can be found in the [Ansible Community Guide](
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html).

## A word of warning

While we want the community to engage in developing this collection, please be
aware, that we have to ensure a certain level of quality and scope.
Additionally, this is purely a side project of a few people, which means
the time available is limited. We will try to be as transparent as possible
about what we will include but please do not feel discouraged, if an idea
or proposal gets rejected. Instead go on and create something yourself,
if you think your approach is viable! There is already a lot of great content
out there and we love seeing you add to that plethora of content!
