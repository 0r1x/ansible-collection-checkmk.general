minor_changes:
  - Lookup modules - Enable usage of ini files, environment and inventory variables
    to configure basic settings for the lookup plugins, like e.g., the server_url or site
    alongside the authentication options. Refer to the module documentation for details.

known_issues:
  - Lookup modules - When using inventory variables to configure e.g., the server_url,
    it is not possible to assign other variables to these variables.
    This is a limitation of Ansble itself.
