minor_changes:
  - Server role - Site management can now be done without specifying 'admin_pw'.

known_issues:
  - Server role - Not having to provide an admin password introduces a problem though, as users could create sites without knowing the randomly generated password. A task is introduced to mitigate this, but the solution there could be improved.
