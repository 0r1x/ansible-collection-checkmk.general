breaking_changes:
  - Variable names - We aligned the names of variables throughout the collection.
    This can impact your existing configuration.
    Please review the variable names and apapt your configuration accordingly.
    For more details see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Agent role - We restructured the agent.
    That entails a lot of changes, and we tried to keep everything stable.
    However, we cannot guarantee stability as we do not know all use-cases out there.
    Hence this change is also considered breaking.
  - Server role - It became necessary to make the way states are handled more consistent.
    The most siginificant change is, that all sites not in state "started" will be stopped.
    For all other states please consult the role's README.
