minor_changes:
  - The way how the API URL is being created is now more consistent. Thus, users can now skip the
    trailing "/" in the "server_url" for all modules. Thanks to Jan Petto
    (https://github.com/Edgxxar)!
known_issues:
  - We might extract the API call handling into a separate Python module.
